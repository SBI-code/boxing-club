### Design

#### Colour Scheme
* The main colours that are used throughout the website pages are Jet #363537, White #ffffff and Seashell #F7EBE8.

#### Typography
* The Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the chosen fonts aren't being imported correctly to the site. Both Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are clear and well structured so they are suited to the genre of the site.

#### Imagery 
* The images used are relevant to the sites purpose and are intended to attract the users attention. The hero image responds to adjusted screen sizes and reveals more of the image.

### Wireframes 
* When designing and planning content positioning for the website I used wireframe to plot the layout for all the pages on mobile first and being responsive on bigger screens.     

The following displays the different interfaces on Home, Gallery and Contact pages for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

* Mobile screens from 280px

## Solved Bugs

Sufficed to say there have been plenty of learning opportunities while developing this site.
I ran my code through HTML and CSS validation services at various points periodically and used Google Developer Tools to identify and correct style issues. 
I had a mid-project run through meeting with my mentor who reviewed my HTML and CSS for the Home page before I went on to create the Gallery and Contact pages to save time with any issues that might have come up.

#### My process for approaching issues has been as follows, upon identifying an error: 
* I reviewed the course content to go back to first principles see if I could find a solution there. 
* Research online.
* Review slack channels to see if other students ran into the same issue.
* If I spent more that 30 mins with no solution, I would contact tutor support for help and advice which happened a few times to correct minor errors in the styling. 

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
#### User Story Tests
This testing ensures that the core mechanics work properly and provides fixes for identified issues. Only user stories tagged (Must-Have) and (Should-Have) have been developed so these are the user stories that have been tested below.

#### User Story 1: User-friendly navigation and responsive design (Must-Have)
* Expected: The website should be fully responsive and allow users to easily navigate between sections across different devices.
* Testing: Tested the website on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) and navigated through different sections.
* Result: On smaller screens, some menu items were not listed, making navigation difficult and navbar hamburger icon was not displaying in the correct place.
* Fix: Added lists to menu items, adjusted CSS styles and corrected the navigation bar to collapse into a hamburger menu on the right of the page heading.

![bug01 screenshot](assets/images/bug01.png)

#### User Story 2: Images and engaging descriptions (Must-Have)
* Expected: The homepage should display a responsive image of a boxer, along with clear descriptions of the boxing clubâ€™s offerings.
* Testing: Loaded the homepage on different screen sizes and checked whether images scaled properly. Also reviewed the readability of class descriptions. 
* Result: Image was stretched and some text overlapped on smaller screens, making descriptions hard to read. About section introduction text and about image were not showing correctly on larger screen sizes.
* Fix: Adjusted CSS to ensure image remained responsive, adjusted image size and adjusted text to maintain proper spacing and readability. Adjusted the HTML to place the image div in a new div with the introduction and reviewed the flexbox styling.

![bug screenshot](assets/images/bug02.png)

#### User Story 3: Showcase boxers and the club setting on a separate Gallery page (Must-Have)
* Expected: The gallery page should feature a grid layout of boxers, club settings, and equipment.
* Testing: Navigated to the Gallery page and observed the layout on different screen sizes.
* Result: The grid layout displayed inconsistently on some devices, with some images getting cut off.
* Fix: Adjusted CSS style settings to ensure a consistent display on all screen sizes by adding media queries with column counts.

![bug screenshot](assets/images/bug03.png)

#### User Story 4: Location, contact details, and opening hours (Must-Have)
* Expected: The location, contact details, and opening hours should be visible and easily accessible from all pages.
* Testing: Checked links in footers to verify if the contact section was accessible and properly displayed. Loaded the pages on multiple screen sizes to check responsivity.
* Result: Address details were not clearly visible on mobile screens and social media icons were squished.
* Fix: Moved the address and contact link to a list and paragraph in the footer for consistent visibility across all pages.

![bug screenshot](assets/images/bug04.png)

#### User Story 5: Contact us inquiry form (Must-Have)
* Expected: The booking inquiry form should be simple, require all fields, and take the user to a success page upon submission.
* Testing: Filled out the form with valid and invalid inputs to test validation and redirection.
* Result: The form allowed submission but issues with placeholder text not showing in the entry fields.
* Fix: Corrected the placeholder elements in the contact HTML.

![bug screenshot](assets/images/bug05.png)

#### User Story 6: Visible pricing for sessions (Should-Have)
* Expected: Pricing information should be clearly displayed alongside session details.
* Testing: Navigated to the pricing section and checked if all session rates were visible.
* Result: All pricing details were visible.
* Fix: No fix required.

#### Details of specific fixes that did not come directly from user stories: 
* Fixed margin-top for main element so it appears under the fixed header.
* Fixed bug that was preventing the social network icons styling to apply to the gallery page footer by removing an extra space in the id text.
* The margin for the home page was causing a white line to appear just above the Hero image. This was fixed by reducing the margin size of the main content.
* Bug that was causing the logo text to wrap when the screen was being adjusted between 770 to 820px. Corrected using â€˜nowrapâ€™ and adjusting menu and logo sizes. 
* Empty navbar form label error highlighted by web accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE). Corrected by adding an â€˜aria-hiddenâ€™ attribute to the label element and adding a span to the label with a class and content value which was set to â€˜display: noneâ€™. The HTML was replicated onto the Gallery and Contact pages.
* Removed redundant links from menu nav for all pages as highlighted by WAVE.
* Contrast error flagged by WAVE on contact page between submit button background and submit button text. Corrected by changing the background to a darker colour.
* Added missing heading to Gallery main section and set display to none.
* Added hidden-heading class to gallery heading to prevent the heading from partially showing in screen sizes lower than tablet size.
* Reason section paragraphs showing the wrong way around on larger screens so reviewed the CSS and adjusted the styles to target to correct paragraphs. 
* Bug was causing the bottom of the contact form to overflow past the footer when reducing the vertical height of the site on desktop. Corrected by removing the absolute positioning that was previously set and added a margin bottom. 

### Unfixed Bugs

There are no active bugs as far as i am aware.

## Deployment

### Version Control

* The site was created using the Gitpod editor and pushed to the remote boxing club repository on Github.com
* Git commands were used regularly during the development of the website using the following Git commands;
    - git add .  - to add changes made to files to the staging area before being committed.
    - git commit -m "commit description" - to commit changes to a file to the queue ready for the final command.
    - git push - used to send the committed files to the Github repository.

For my git commits I used the following naming convention to easily identify different types of commit messages; 
- Feature - feat
- Bug fix - fix
- CSS changes - style
- Document changes - docs
- General maintenance - maint

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you find the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section. 
    Please click here to find the live site [Float & Sting Boxing](https://sbi-code.github.io/boxing-club/)

### Gitpod

1. I logged into GitPod and navigated to the workspaces section to set up my IDE.
2. Clicking on new workspace and in putting the repository URL, 
3. The IDE was created.

    I could also click on the 'Gitpod' button in the top right-hand corner of my repository page on github which would redirect me straight into my workspace.

### Visual Studio Code

I had to switch over from using Gitpod to VS Code due to an institutional decision to make the switch.

1. I followed the tutorials to set up VS Code and all other required installations on my laptop,
2. I created folders for vscode-projects in my folders, 
3. I added folders specific to the memory game,
4. I opened te project folder in VS Code,
5. On GitHub i navigated to my repository and copied the HTTPS URL,
6. Back to VS Code, i then used git clone followed by the copied URL to connect my GitHub repository to VS Code.
7. And finally a quick check to make sure it was all connected by pushing a small change to see if the commit appeared on GitHub.

### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SBI-code/memory-game)
2. At the top of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.
