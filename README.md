### Design

#### Colour Scheme
* The main colours that are used throughout the website pages are Jet #363537, White #ffffff and Seashell #F7EBE8.

#### Typography
* The Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the chosen fonts aren't being imported correctly to the site. Both Encode Sans SC and Roboto fonts are clear and well structured so they are suited to the genre of the site.

#### Imagery 
* The images used are relevant to the sites purpose and are intended to attract the users attention. The hero image responds to adjusted screen sizes and reveals more of the image.

### Wireframes 
* When designing and planning content positioning for the website I used wireframe to plot the layout for all the pages on mobile first and being responsive on bigger screens.     

The following displays the different interfaces on Home, Gallery and Contact pages for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

* Mobile screens from 280px

## Solved Bugs

Sufficed to say there have been plenty of learning opportunities while developing this site.
I ran my code through HTML and CSS validation services at various points periodically and used Google Developer Tools to identify and correct style issues. 
I had a mid-project run through meeting with my mentor who reviewed my HTML and CSS for the Home page before I went on to create the Gallery and Contact pages to save time with any issues that might have come up.

#### My process for approaching issues has been as follows, upon identifying an error: 
* I reviewed the course content to go back to first principles see if I could find a solution there. 
* Research online.
* Review slack channels to see if other students ran into the same issue.
* If I spent more that 30 mins with no solution, I would contact tutor support for help and advice which happened a few times to correct minor errors in the styling. 

#### Details of specific fixes: 
* Fixed margin-top for main element so it appears under the fixed header.
* Fixed bug that was preventing the social network icons styling to apply to the gallery page footer by removing an extra space in the id text.
* Inserted cropped version of the Hero image so it is better positioned on larger screens as image was not rendering correctly.
* The margin for the home page was causing a white line to appear just above the Hero image. This was fixed by reducing the margin size of the main content.
* Bug that was causing the logo text to wrap when the screen was being adjusted between 770 to 820px. Corrected using â€˜nowrapâ€™ and adjusting menu and logo sizes. 
* Empty navbar form label error highlighted by web accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE). Corrected by adding an â€˜aria-hiddenâ€™ attribute to the label element and adding a span to the label with a class and content value which was set to â€˜display: noneâ€™. The HTML was replicated onto the Gallery and Contact pages.
* Removed redundant links from menu nav for all pages as highlighted by WAVE.
* Contrast error flagged by WAVE on contact page between submit button background and submit button text. Corrected by changing the background to a darker colour.
* Added missing heading to Gallery main section and set display to none.
* Added hidden-heading class to gallery heading to prevent the heading from partially showing in screen sizes lower than tablet size.
* Reason section paragraphs showing the wrong way around on larger screens so reviewed the CSS and adjusted the styles to target to correct paragraphs. 
* Bug was causing the bottom of the contact form to overflow past the footer when reducing the vertical height of the site on desktop. Corrected by removing the absolute positioning that was previously set and added a margin bottom. 

## Deployment

### Version Control

* The site was created using the Gitpod editor and pushed to the remote boxing club repository on Github.com
* Git commands were used regularly during the development of the website using the following Git commands;
    - git add .  - to add changes made to files to the staging area before being committed.
    - git commit -m "commit description" - to commit changes to a file to the queue ready for the final command.
    - git push - used to send the committed files to the Github repository.

For my git commits I used the following naming convention to easily identify different types of commit messages; 
- Feature - feat
- Bug fix - fix
- CSS changes - style
- Document changes - docs
- General maintenance - maint

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
